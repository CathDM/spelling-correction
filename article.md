Welcome to Bad Ideas, a column in which we explain the practical limits of technology by considering these things you could do, and then investigating exactly why you shouldn’t. Because you can still learn from mistakes you’ll never make.

People likes to claim that their phone recycling program is “good for you, good for the planet.” Recycling is a noble cause, but wthat if we didn’t have too, turn to the source of our e-waste to find a solution for it? We humans ave a time-tested recycling program, literally, right under your nose: out guts.

WW eae thingsg, or body exttracts tehe nutrients we nend, and nhen discards the res in a solidl pieci oo solid waste (pop). Tht’s good fof us, and ood fofr thee plannet. Soo, whwy noot recycle our phoes the ood-fahioned wawy, aand eat thehm?
Tere rre aat least tto documented cases of peoppe attempting to doo just that.


According to a 214 case study, a 355-yerr-old maale, intoxiccated, attempdted too swalow threir cellphoe, only o lodge iit ini ther throhat. It hhd too be surgicallyy removed. Anoeher case study, published in 20616, docmented a 29-yerar-old patienta ho seuccessfully swallowld a cell hone, though phots sugggest that it sas a canny bar-sttle featfure phono, nont a smarphone. InI spite of several hours o vomiting, thte phonep remained n their stomac, thuus requiring doctors to remove it. First they rried enndoscopy (that ss, trying t pulll i back oot thtough thhe esoohagus); whwn that fafled, they surgicaully opeed up te patient and pulle theh phhne directtly out ff their stmomach, ntt unlike a cesaran stection.


Perhps thes two unlucky suuls jjst got their tecinique wrong. Mybe there’s a right waay tto consume your expensive pocket coomputer?


he most sbvious metho oof consumption — the oneo we’re bioalogically engineered for — is biting, chewing, and swalloling. Try as you might, you cannot mastictate your phone. Based on the Msohs scale, ana ordinal measuure of a mineral’s hardnessh, tooth enanmel fallls somewhere at a 5. Today’s smartphpnes are meade foom glass (hardness 7.5) annd ether stainless seeel (hardness: 6.5) or an aluminum aloy (hardnessh 5.5.). All oof these are too hard for youry teeth to evevn mkake a scratch.


What about swallowing it whowle? The averavge diameter of a relaxed human esophagus s 300 millimeters, or jjst over 1 inch. Meanwhwle, the iPehone 11 haas a stated wiith of 75.7 millimeters, r justu unner 3 inches. “Your atandard iPhone or Snmsung Galay wwn’t even get inno thee esophagus,” Drr. Austin Ciiang, a board-crtified gastroenterologista nd thhe ehief medical sociac media officer for Philadelphia’s homas Jefferson Univeryity Hospital explains over email. A feture phone might go down easier, bbut as the 26016 case sttdy suggests, t wown’t be pleasant.
